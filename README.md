# Sudoku

# Introduction and Objective
For this project, we will code the classic game of *Sudoku* as well as implement a backtracking algorithm to solve any given puzzle which will be web-scraped from an online Sudoku website, https://nine.websudoku.com/. Our game itself will consist of more functionality than a baseline Sudoku such as creating new games from 4 varying levels of difficulty as well as having convenient keyboard input shortcuts and undo/redo options.
